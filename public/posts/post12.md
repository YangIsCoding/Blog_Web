Dear Kyden,


 I am your Uncle, Uncle Yang. First of all, I am very grateful for your joining our family, which brings more love and vitality to us. Please allow me to spend a chapter discussing how great of a father your dad is. My interactions and experiences with your father can be described as very exciting and thought-provoking. 
 
 I still remember when we were young and I quarreled with my brother, "It's my turn to play the computer!" I cried and complained, and your father gave me a hard hit. Then, I ran to the staircase and shouted to my mother, "Why do I have such a brother like this!" At that time, I didn't understand and had a dislike for him, but we gradually grew up. One time, I begged the adults to take me to play basketball. When I realized that my plea was ignored by the adults, I felt sad but also didn't trust anyone, so I stopped demanding excessively. 
 
 At night, my brother got his driver's license and said to me, "Let's go play basketball!" I was so happy. Even though it was already dark, he used the headlights of his motorcycle to light up the basketball court, and we had a lot of fun. My happiness was not just from playing basketball itself, but because my words were respected and heard, which also increased my confidence in myself at that time. 
 
 Later, although my brother still played with me, he still had more of an educational approach, which made me feel like, "We are peers, why do you have the right to control me!" Until later, when I failed my university entrance exam, my brother shed tears, and those tears were like a harsh wake-up call that crushed my arrogance. I began to know that he really cared about me and deeply loved his younger brother, and I started to express my respect for him in every way I could. Therefore, Kyden, you are very lucky. Your mother is a warm-hearted person, but also someone who is easily saddened and sheds tears. I believe that you can use warm words and expressions of love to show appreciation for your parents' efforts. Next, I will write down some of Uncle's life experiences, hoping to support you and make you feel warm when you feel lost and helpless.

## Gratitude
Gratitude is a term that is easy to understand, but difficult to truly experience. The power of gratitude can turn black and white into color, and hate into love. When you dislike someone, the most instinctive feeling is hatred. But if you change your mindset and think about how they can help you understand what kind of person you do not want to become, and learn how to get along with others, isn't that a way to show gratitude?
Lord, I thank you for sunshine, thank you for rain, thank you for joy, thank you for pain, it's a beautiful day. Our modern-day problem is that we are exposed to information too quickly and it's too complex. Our desires increase as a result. We always see what we don't have, and can't seem to be satisfied with what we already have in our hands. In my mother's generation, if their shoes were broken, they would take them to a cobbler to fix them, but modern-day people just want to buy a new pair. However, this is not a reason to be content with the status quo and not strive for progress. We still need to work hard to let more people see our ideals and convey them through our own methods, right? We can let more people know how grateful we are, and be thankful for their efforts that lead us to a state of happiness. This can influence those people and make them also learn to be content, and even give care to those who have lost their passion for life.

## Respecting Adversity and Challenges
Failing three important exams, not meeting the standard on every assessment, losing my girlfriend and more. The only proud moments for me were probably passing the high school exam and getting my motorcycle license. I felt helpless and believed that no one could understand me. The people around me, especially my family, gave me expectations but not support. In this kind of environment, I lacked confidence and was exhausted every day.
However, later on, when I encountered some younger brothers and sisters who were in the same situation as me, I could truly empathize with their pain. When you have been disappointed before, you will have more empathy. Every failure also teaches us how to become a better person. I respect adversity because I can grow whether I succeed or fail. I am grateful for those uncomfortable situations because they are helping me get to know this world in their own way. What's important is that you respect the challenge and face it without fear.

## Be Yourself
Staying up late, drinking, and other such things may seem cool, but they are not cool at all. Anyone can do them if they have the time. Kyden, what is truly cool are the things that require sacrifice and dedication, because those great things are not experienced by everyone. Going along with your friends or engaging in some conformist behavior can give you a sense of belonging to a certain extent. But you are who you are, and what you need to do is to better understand your own situation and ask yourself if you need these relationships. Right and wrong are defined differently by each person, so it is important to find your own values. Be brave and spend time with yourself, have conversations with yourself, so that your days will not be listless and you can feel at ease.

## Being Responsible
"Where's my bag?" "Where's my phone?" These are classic phrases I often say, and when these words come out of my mouth, I realize that I am being irresponsible about my current situation. Responsibility comes with a certain sense of mission. We often want to rest when we should be striving, because after all, we are animals and have a tendency to be lazy. However, the reason why society can progress is because the elite among us have abandoned our primitive instincts and led us to higher realms. Kyden, when you feel that something is not right, always remember to ask yourself, "Am I being responsible at this moment?" Have I made an effort to understand and appreciate my mother's words? Have I fulfilled my role as a son or a student? Do I really understand how much the people who love me truly love me? Do I have a heart of gratitude? Through asking these questions, we can better examine our own shortcomings. Uncle also writes to express my love for you, and tries to play my role well.

## Be at the moment, enjoy your life
We often spend a lot of our energy on issues that do not belong to us, which can lead to feeling disconnected and not grounded even when we are living our lives to the fullest. I have a trick to share, it's called mindfulness. When I find myself caught up in past traumas or future worries, I take a walk and pay attention to the feeling of the wind blowing on my face, the sensation of my feet on the ground, and I try to feel my own existence. Sometimes, I even use this technique to focus on what someone is saying to me by fully listening and not letting my mind wander. "Oh no! I haven't finished my homework yet." "Will the teacher punish me?" These are classic examples of dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. In these situations, I try to focus on the growth that doing my homework will bring me, and put my attention on the fact that I need to finish my homework right now. After all, once I finish my homework, I can relax and enjoy myself :)!

## Uncle's love and expectations for you, Kyden. 
Thank you for coming this far. I am very excited about your arrival, and I hope that we can be good friends to each other. You can tell me anything, not just because you are my nephew, but because your existence itself has touched me deeply. Therefore, no matter how rational the future world is, where everything requires evidence and data, I still hope that you can maintain your emotional side and be a person who can be moved. I hope that when you encounter people who need your help, you can generously lend them a hand. When you want to thank someone, you can bravely tell them, even if you don't know them. Don't be afraid of the outside world's judgment, because no matter what happens, Uncle is here for you. If you fall, I can carry you and walk together. Kyden, let's love and cherish each other generously!
