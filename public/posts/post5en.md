# Materialism vs. Idealism

I used to be an extreme materialist. Materialism is the belief that everything is caused by matter, including your emotions (which might be caused by dopamine, endorphins, serotonin fluctuations), the ability to raise your hand (thanks to acetylcholine transmitting signals between your nerve cells), and of course, your consciousness. So, humans don't really have free will—it's all just the workings of your brain. Everything has a cause and effect, which means the future is predetermined (this falls under determinism). What consciousness, what future? Discussing these things is pointless because everything has already been decided.

Why did I later become a proponent of idealism? Below is the process, unrelated to the debate between idealism and materialism.

1. I realized that the friend I knew as "Friend A" was not actually "Friend A," but rather "the Friend A I know." So, we can never truly comprehend everything; humans are incapable of understanding the truth of the world. The world I know is not the world itself, but the world as I perceive it.

2. I believe that the reason people pursue goals is to maximize their cognitive boundaries. To put it emotionally, it's to prove whether God exists or to prove that we ourselves are God (like when we discuss human selective influence along with natural selection, write AI capable of machine learning, or control a mouse's DNA). So how do we maximize human collective knowledge? First, by extending lifespan. Second, by reproducing. So, when our physical bodies reach their limits, all organs—heart, liver, bones—become risks. They might develop cancer, right? So, wouldn't it be better to replace them with machines? If they break, they can be repaired (like the stents, prosthetics, and ECMO machines we have now). But what about the brain? Don't we need a massive database to upload everything from the brain? To me, this massive database is a collective consciousness. It controls everything, defines the world’s formulas (the unified theory discussed in philosophy). Just like we need to define the schema module for a database. So, do we have no free will anymore? Everything has been predefined, right?

3. I believe that even though the formulas are defined, the parameters are filled in by you. But why aren't the parameters predetermined?

a. The Von Neumann double-slit quantum measurement suggests that the measurement process is considered to apply a specific set of observation operators to a quantum system, and the results surprisingly change depending on these operators.
In simpler terms, if you observe it intentionally, the quantum won't show you interference; if you don't observe it intentionally, the quantum will interfere with each other.

b. Roger Penrose’s theory of quantum phenomena in the brain. Before explaining this, let me share Benjamin Libet’s research on the brain. He observed that before people made decisions, their brains had already reacted in advance, suggesting that we have no control, even over our thoughts (Laplace's demon). However, Roger Penrose tells us that, in fact, there's a quantum-like fully random interference in our brains, which leads us to make our own decisions.

I remember after finishing my GRE, I saw migratory birds flying across the sky. I thought it was beautiful, and I felt like they appeared in my view just for me. They might not have realized they made someone feel so good, but after all the random parameters were filled in, they appeared. I am the world; the world is me. How I perceive the world is how the world is.

So, I believe that we are also part of this great consciousness. "It" exists in your heart, my heart, in the trees, flowers, clouds, and oceans. This world is beautiful—go experience the stories this consciousness brings us. Pain is beautiful; happiness is beautiful too. Okay?

Well, I may not be a philosopher, but that sounds pretty awesome, right?

This is my optimistic philosophy. Haha. There are many more topics to discuss; maybe I shouldn't write any more confusing stuff in my notes next time.
