Dear Niece,

*May you be like a flower: 

May you be as bright as a sunflower under the shining sun.
As steadfast as a cotton tree in midsummer.
As pure as a small white flower on the grass.
As peaceful as a daffodil under careful care.*

Dear little flower: I am your little uncle, and this is the first letter of your life. I hope that in the storms and fears you encounter in life, you can find the most sincere and steadfast strength by reading this letter over and over, to accompany you throughout your life.

I can already imagine your drowsy expression, the way you first encounter the world, with your mom and dad joyfully yet gently holding you close to their chests, with your cute and innocent brother clapping his hands to cheer for you. There's grandpa, grandma, your grand-uncles, great-grandparents, aunt, big uncle, and little uncle all eagerly waiting to give you heartfelt blessings. Perhaps your expression is confused, or maybe you feel afraid of these unfamiliar faces, but let us all grow with you, sharing the sweetness of life with you.

Gratitude and contentment are the first lessons Mother Earth gives you. With this mindset, your heart will be at peace, and you can calm a troubled soul. You will know how lucky you are, knowing that you are always deeply loved. My dear niece, think more about what you have, and don’t worry about what you don’t have. You must know that in the eyes of others, you are so enviable! You must understand that from the time you were in your mother’s womb, you were blessed. Your family is willing to walk with you through obstacles. Look into your parents' eyes! You will see yourself there; they will smile, and you will find that they are so grateful to have you.

Perseverance and courage are important mindsets for the journey of life. In the near future, I will hold your hand, and step by step, we will walk around parks, neighborhoods, schools, weddings, and the world. When you fall, perhaps we won’t immediately pick up your bruised knees, but you will become braver each time, your gaze more determined, lifting yourself up, carrying on with what you love, and we will always be here. As you overcome difficulties, the warm sunlight will gently caress your wounds, and you will be fine, while the experience will be etched into your heart. My dear niece, I hope that when you face setbacks, you will share them with me. I will exhaust all I’ve learned to offer my footprints to you. I hope I can be a qualified uncle, trusted and relied upon by you.

When writing this letter, I am 22 years old. Although my experience is insufficient, I must share with you how important “optimism” is. The most beautiful side of a sunflower is the one that faces the sun. Optimism is not forcing a smile, nor is it choosing to eat hotpot to relieve stress during a crisis. Optimism is always believing that there is still a way, still a path to take, and actively moving forward. Optimism is not just about happiness; we can obtain happiness from brief moments of joy. But optimism can wash away sadness with time. A boatman on a boat can choose to lament the fatigue of rowing, or he can choose to enjoy the cool evening breeze and the twinkling stars.

Little flower, I have many more things I want to say to you, and I will slowly share them with you over time. I will deeply love you, I will hold you, let you play with my hair, pinch my nose, I will take you to buy toys, play ball, chat with you, take photos in flower fields, and build our family’s castle by the sea. I will tie little flowers in your hair, just as I have tied you to my heart with words.

May God plant the seed of my niece in a garden of happiness until you become a flower unafraid of wind and frost.
