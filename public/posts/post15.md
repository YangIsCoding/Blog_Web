# What exactly is Web3.0?

Congratulations, you’re living in a time of transformation!

Nowadays, we see more people shifting from traditional financial markets to the Web3 space. To help you better understand this trend, let’s take a closer look at the historical context and explain how Web3.0 is being applied across various industries.

## Web1.0
In the Web 1.0 era of static web pages (1990s), websites were mainly made up of static HTML pages and lacked dynamic content generation. People could (only) **read and view** content on the internet. Businesses could post advertisements, and media outlets could publish news. During this time, computers also became more widespread.

## Web2.0
The Web 2.0 era (2000s) introduced interactivity and user-generated content. Web 2.0 is an era that focuses on interaction and user-generated content, which is the form of the internet most of us are familiar with today. In this period, companies like Facebook encouraged people to join their communities and express their ideas. Indeed, people entered the **"writing"** era.

## Web3.0
Nowadays, there are many competing definitions of Web3. I prefer to define it as the "participation" or "join" era. Web3 introduces the concepts of decentralization and user-controlled data, using blockchain technology to make the internet more democratic and transparent. People can participate in DAO organizations they're interested in by holding specific tokens, such as NFTs and staking pools! We can digitize assets (like financial statements, artwork, etc.), and they are unique — **now it’s time to build your own little world!**

## BNS and DAI
I know that blockchain can be a challenging concept to grasp because it focuses on the transportation layer rather than the application layer. But in this ecosystem, technologies like BNS (Blockchain Name Service) simplify access to blockchain assets by mapping complex wallet addresses to human-readable names, enhancing the user experience. I **promise** that we will make blockchain more widespread, abstract more of the complex details, and bring it closer to our daily lives.

Finally, DAI (Decentralized Artificial Intelligence) is another emerging industry you need to know about!

Traditional AI models require massive amounts of data for training, and this data is usually held by large companies or institutions. In decentralized AI, data is stored across different nodes or individuals, avoiding the problem of data centralization and enhancing privacy protection. Through blockchain or distributed storage systems, data can be securely shared and used without revealing private information.

## Fire up your Web3 world!

Thank you for listening to me buzzing around. I hope you’ve gained some basic knowledge about why we’re here today. The Web3.0 world is a highly open-minded space (as you know, Web3.0 emphasizes the word **"community"** a lot). Feel free to reach out to me and share your experiences!
